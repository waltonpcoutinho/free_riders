We consider games with n players, n>=2. The number n usually does not need 
to be passed as a parameter, as the length of certain vectors, or the number
of rows or columns of certain matrices will be equal to n. Depending on the 
context one can then retrieve n by a command of the form [n m] = size(A).

For the set \mathcal{N} = \{ 1, \ldots, n \}, we encode any subset of
\mathcal{N} by a 0/1 column vector of length n. If x is the vector representing
the set S, then x(i)==1 if and only if i \in S.

A collection of subsets of \mathcal{N} is simply a matrix with columns that 
encode these subsets.

A partition of \mathcal{N} is encoded by a matrix with n rows, where each
column represents a subset of \mathcal{N}. Let P be such a matrix and let 
m be the number of columns of P, i.e. m is the number of sets in the partition. 
We can then check if P indeed represents a partition by checking if
P*e_m = e_n, where e_m resp. e_n are vectors of length m resp. n, of all 1's.

The function compA constructs all possible nonempty subsets of \mathcal{N}. 
For example, comp(3) gives

     1     0     1     0     1     0     1
     0     1     1     0     0     1     1
     0     0     0     1     1     1     1

where each column represents one unique subset. Note that for A=comp(n),
the matrix A has n rows and 2^n -1 columns.

The output of compA(n) induces a natural numbering (or order) of all subsets 
of \mathcal{N}. We number subsets by their column number. In the above,
subset no. 1 is { 1 }, subset no. 2 is { 2 }, subset no. 3 is { 1, 2 }, while 
subset no. 7 is { 1, 2, 3 }. We will use this ordering throughout.

The function CompPart(n) computes all partitions of the set \mathcal{N} and stores
the result in a cell array. For example, list=CompPart(3) produces an array list
with

list{1} =
     1     0
     1     0
     0     1

list{2} =
     1     0     0
     0     1     0
     0     0     1

list{3} =
     1
     1
     1

list{4} =
     1     0
     0     1
     1     0

list{5} =
     1     0
     0     1
     0     1

Note that CompPart(13) produces already a list with 27,644,437 entries, see
https://oeis.org/A000110. MATLAB stores this in a cell array with 19,853,529,488 bytes.

Note that CompPart does not sort the partitions into their natural partial order.
Nevertheless, we will use the order induced by the output of CompPart throughout.
For example, the partition described by

     1     0
     0     1
     1     0

will be denoted as the fourth partition, as it is stored as list{4}.

A game with free riders (externalities) is now defined by a payoff or value
function v that provides a payoff value v(S; P) for each partition P of
\mathcal{N} and each set S \in P. We store these values in a cell array
'payoff'.  payoff{i} is a vector of payoff values related to partition no. I.
Let P be partition no. i and let values=payoff{i}. The partition P is
represented as a matrix, with each column representing one set of P. 
For columns 1, \ldots, m of this matrix, let S_1, \ldots, m be the
corresponding subsets. We then have values[j] = v(S_j, P).
In particular, if P has m subsets, then values is a vector of length m.

Other data needed:

zmax: can be computed by compzmax.m. zmax is a matrix with n rows and 
2^n-1 entries. Column no. i of zmax corresponds to subset i of { 1, \ldots, n }, 
as stored in the output of comp(n). If T is subset no. i, then 
zmax(k, i) = z_k^{max} (T), the latter as defined in Subsection 2.2.1.

vi_max: cell array with the following meaning. vi_max{j} contains data related 
to partition P=partition{j}. In particular,  vi_max{j} is a vector of length n, 
with vi_max{j}[i] the largest right-hand side showing up in the imputation 
constraints x_i \geq v( \{ i \} ; .... ) of I(P).
