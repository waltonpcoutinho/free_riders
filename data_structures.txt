We consider games with n players, n>=2. The number n usually does not need 
to be passed as a parameter, as the length of certain vectors, or the number
of rows or columns of certain matrices will be equal to n. Depending on the 
context one can then retrieve n by a command of the form [n m] = size(A).

For the set \mathcal{N} = \{ 1, \ldots, n \}, we encode any subset of
\mathcal{N} by a 0/1 column vector of length n. If x is the vector representing
the set S, then x(i)==1 if and only if i \in S.

A collection of subsets of \mathcal{N} is simply a matrix with columns that 
encode these subsets.

A partition of \mathcal{N} is encoded by a matrix with n rows, where each
column represents a subset of \mathcal{N}. Let P be such a matrix and let 
m be the number of columns of P, i.e. m is the number of sets in the partition. 
We can then check if P indeed represents a partition by checking if
P*e_m = e_n, where e_m resp. e_n are vectors of length m resp. n, of all 1's.

The function compA constructs all possible nonempty subsets of \mathcal{N}. 
For example, comp(3) gives

     1     0     1     0     1     0     1
     0     1     1     0     0     1     1
     0     0     0     1     1     1     1

where each column represents one unique subset. Note that for A=comp(n),
the matrix A has n rows and 2^n -1 columns.

The output of compA(n) induces a natural numbering (or order) of all subsets 
of \mathcal{N}. We number subsets by their column number. In the above,
subset no. 1 is { 1 }, subset no. 2 is { 2 }, subset no. 3 is { 1, 2 }, while 
subset no. 7 is { 1, 2, 3 }. We will use this ordering throughout.
